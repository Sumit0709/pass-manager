## Introduction

Pass Manager is a simple and secure password manager written in Go. It allows you to store and manage your passwords in a secure and convenient way, so you don’t have to remember them all or write them down on paper.
__But make sure to always remember your secret !!__

## Features

- __Secure storage:__ Pass Manager uses strong encryption to protect your passwords and keep them safe from prying eyes. Your passwords are encrypted and decrypted on the fly, so they are never stored in plain text.
- __Easy to use:__ Pass Manager has an intuitive command-line interface that makes it easy to use, even if you’re not familiar with the command line. You can quickly add, retrieve, update, and delete passwords with just a few simple commands.
- __Cross-platform:__ Pass Manager is written in Go, which means it can run on any platform that supports Go, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- __Password generation__: Supports random password generation of various types eg. numerical, alpha-numerical, etc..

## Installation

If you have go installed, you can run:

``` shell
go install github.com/Sumit0709/pass-manager@latest
```

This will put the binary inside __$GOPATH/bin__ directory.

Else you can download the binary for your os and architecture from bin folder and add it to your 'environment Path variable' to access it from anywhere.
